# Medical-Assistance-Chatbot
A smart Medical Assistant Chatbot that predicts possible diseases based on user-described symptoms using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. 

This project demonstrates how to combine **TF-IDF vectorization**, **text preprocessing**, and **ensemble classification models** in a Flask-powered web interface.
## üîç Features

- Takes free-form symptom input from users (e.g., "I have a rash and feel dizzy")
- Uses **NLP** to preprocess text (tokenizing, stemming, vectorizing)
- Uses a **Voting Classifier** with Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
- Predicts the most probable disease based on trained data
- Flask-based web interface for easy interaction
